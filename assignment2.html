    Assignment 2: <font color="#E0E0E0">
    I found several common themes among the websites I reviewed. Streaming was a popular category,and was included in every website I reviews. Popular streaming services appeared to be music applications such as Spotify, as well as Netflix, Youtube, and different Podcast networks. Video games were also popular, and there was surprisingly specific video games that were very common, most notably Rocket League and Call of Duty. These are both multiplayer games, which may indicate that members of our class and possibly our age group more broadly prefer to play video games with friends. News was also a repeated category, though descriptions of this varied more. News media may be a sensitive category right now given the current political environment, and that may be contributing to a desire among students to either remain vague about their prefered news media or to be sure and portray a media diet they consider "balanced".

            <ul>
                <li>Jarrett and I had an interesting similarity in our descriptions of why we are taking this class. We both have a desire to learn about the impact of technology on society. </li>
                <li>Common media between the two of us included video games and streaming services.</li>
                <li>Jarrett listed social media under "Applications/Games" which I found interesting. I made social media its own category, which suggests a difference in how the two of us perceive these services.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Cody had very different categories than me. He tended to group media based on their sensory impact or physical medium, whereas I grouped them by purpose.</li>
                <li>Common media included video games and Reddit. </li>
